Ongoing Event\nThis event is running at LOCATION between the dates 2024-08-08 and 2024-08-14. Saint-Briac-Sur-Mer, France. 2024 # In collaboration with Chantal Blanchy.\nEdison, Washington, United States. 2022 # The brush in the medium of sumi only paints lines and dots. Theses strokes evoke the rain, sky, horizons of my paintings. In many ways, I feel the continuation of the cave drawings of bison, reindeer and other animals from 35,000 years ago. We still create images which are significant to us in some way.\nI also painted wooden dolls, who represent ordinary people experiencing the past 12 months. They are a front-line worker, a little boy with a Trump balloon, a voter, a Black Lives Matter demonstrator and someone looking at his cellphone on January 6, 2021. These traditional dolls are called kokeshi in Japanese. I find them in second-hand stores, sand away the original patterns, then paint them into new forms. The same paints are used for sumi and kokeshi dolls.\nTemporary Province, Country. 2021 # "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/contact/contact/","title":"Contact","section":"Docs","content":"www\nfor purchase inquireis, please contact me below\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/posts/blog_post1/","title":"Example Blog Post 1","section":"Blog","content":" Introduction # Example Text\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Example Blog Post 2","section":"Blog","content":" Example Header # "}]
