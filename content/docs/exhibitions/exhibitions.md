### Edison, Washington, United States. 2022
![Image 1 of Exhibition](/images/exhibitions/edison1.webp)
The brush in the medium of sumi only paints lines and dots. Theses strokes
evoke the rain, sky, horizons of my paintings. In many ways, I feel the continuation
of the cave drawings of bison, reindeer and other animals from 35,000 years ago.
We still create images which are significant to us in some way.  
I also painted wooden dolls, who represent ordinary people experiencing
the past 12 months. They are a front-line worker, a little boy with a Trump
balloon, a voter, a Black Lives Matter demonstrator and someone looking at his
cellphone on January 6, 2021. These traditional dolls are called kokeshi in
Japanese. I find them in second-hand stores, sand away the original patterns,
then paint them into new forms. The same paints are used for sumi and kokeshi
dolls.
